## Situation:

- A telecom company faced significant customer churn, causing revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.
- The company was looking to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies to minimize churn.
- There was a significant dataset containing customer demographics, service usage, and account information.

## Task:

- Develop a predictive machine learning model that would accurately identify the customers with a high probability of churning.
- Analyze customer data to understand the key drivers of churn behavior.
- Develop actionable insights for the company to create effective customer retention programs.

## Action:

- Did exploratory data analysis to understand data distributions, detect potential outliers, and explore relationships between customer attributes and churn.
- Engineered new features from existing data, such as tenure, average monthly revenue per user (ARPU), and service bundles.
- Implemented and evaluated various machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- Used hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and cross-validation to optimize the performance of the model.
- Designed a strong model evaluation framework using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.
- Generated reports and visualizations that could communicate findings and actionable insights to stakeholders.

## Result:
- Developed a high-performing churn prediction model with 85% accuracy.
- Identified key drivers of customer churn, such as contract expiration, high monthly charges, and lack of bundled services.
- Provided actionable recommendations for customer retention strategies, including:
- Targeted offers and promotions for at-risk customers.
- Proactive customer outreach and engagement.
- Service improvements based on identified pain points.
- Contributed to a significant reduction in customer churn rates, leading to improved customer retention and increased revenue for the telecom company.
